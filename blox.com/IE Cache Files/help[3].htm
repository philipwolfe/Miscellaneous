<h1>2 Presentation Basics</h1>

  
<h2>2.1 Who cares about presentations?</h2>

<p>Traditionally, presentation programs like MS PowerPoint and Adobe's Persuasion are tools used by business people to convince other business people why they should spend their entire marketing budget on a single superbowl ad; why a business that's losing millions a month should be valued at a billion dollars; or why a company introducing web based versions of traditional applications should be regarded as the next big thing on the Internet. People who are good at these things retire young. We're still working... </p>

<p>Conceptually, presentation software is pretty easy to understand. You've got a bunch of slides that can be edited, arranged, sorted, and displayed. You can add pictures and graphical elements to these slides, and each slide has some special elements associated with it: 1) a master slide which is essentially a template that contains background graphics and which establishes text formatting rules, 2) a slide title, and 3) a slide outline containing the slides bullet points. One of the innovations introduced by Adobe's Persuasion was the "outline view," which allowed all the slide text to be edited and arranged within a text outline.</p>

<p>The Blox.com presentation contains most of the standard features of "land-based" presentation programs, plus a few interesting innovations of its own. As a "connected" application, it enjoys the benefits of all web-based apps: you can access it from any connected computer, you never have to worry about backup, installation, upgrades, dll-conflicts, etc. Additionally, since the output of the Blox.com presentation <i>is</i> a web page, the program can, in fact, be viewed as the world's easiest web page editor. You can use it to build personal slide shows - not just boring marketing presentations.</p>

<p>One of the real innovations in the presentation app - like the Blox.com spreadsheet - is its connection to the huge database we call the Internet. Of course, you can embed spreadsheets in presentation slides, and those spreadsheets can automatically update themselves with dynamic data (like stock quotes) from the Internet. But, the presentation app includes some of the spreadsheet intelligence of Blox.com spreadsheet. You can add <i>inline</i> functions and calculations to text in titles and outlines, that update dynamically. For example, the text, "AlphaBlox's stock is now =quote("hbrn")", would resolve to "AlphaBlox's stock is now 158" (or it will 24 hrs after our IPO).</p>

<p>This is very cool stuff! This technology allows you to create presentations that automatically update themselves with current information each time the file is opened. And they can pull data from other spreadsheets, as well as live data sources. Imagine building your "marketing stats" presentation once, and having it always up-to-date.</p>


<h2>2.2 The Blox.com presentation Workspace</h2>

<p>The following features and tools make up the presentation Workspace.</p>

<p class="helpCaption">Figure 2a: The Blox.com presentation Workspace</p>

<h3>2.2.1 The Outline View</h3>
<p>The first thing you see when you open a new presentation is the Outline View in the frame on the left side of the window (where it says, "Slide Folders"), and the Slide Editor in the right side of the window (where it says <b>Introduction</b>). The Outline View is an important organizational tool and it's often convenient to start building your presentation's structure in the Outline View. In the Outline View, you can create and edit slide text, change the order of slides, and select slides for editing. To see your presentation in Outline view, click  <img src="/img/help/pr_outline_view_btn.gif" width=21 height=21 border=0> (the Outline View button) in the bottom left corner of your presentation window. For more instructions see <a href="/help?id=pr_outline">Using the Outline</a>.</p>
	
<h3>2.2.2 The Slide Editor</h3>
<p>The Slide Editor occupies the right side of your presentation window and displays each slide. As you add text, pictures, lines, and other elements to your slide, you will see the changes immediately in the Slide Editor. The Outline and Slide Editor are linked. The slide text can be changed in either the outline or slide views, and changes will automatically propagate to the other view. The Slide Editor is, essentially the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) version of each slide, while the outline view is useful for seeing your presentation as a whole. In the slide editor, you can click directly on the slide elements to reposition them, change their size, and select them for editing. You can adjust the relative sizes of the Outline and Slide Editor by dragging the vertical bar separating the two views to the left or to the right. For more instructions see <a href="/help?id=pr_slide_editor">Using the Slide Editor</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2.3 The Slide Sorter</h3>
<p>The Slide Sorter shows all the slides in your presentation at once as thumbnail images in the order they will appear in your slideshow. The Slide Sorter gives you an overview of your entire presentation. You can drag-and-drop the thumbnails in Slide Sorter Mode to rearrange the order of your slides. </p>

<p>To see your presentation in Slide Sorter Mode click  <img src="/img/help/pr_slide_sorter_btn.gif" width=21 height=22 border=0> (the Slide Sorter button) in the bottom left corner of your presentation window. For more instructions see <a href="/help?id=pr_slideshows">Sorting Slides</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2.4 Slideshow Mode</h3>
<p>To see your presentation as a slideshow, click <img src="/img/help/pr_slideshow_btn.gif" width=22 height=19 border=0>(the Slideshow button) in the bottom left corner of your presentation window. Use this button to present your slideshow to an audience and to check your work as you are building your slides. This gives you a chance to practice and review your presentation content exactly as it will appear to your audience. For more instructions see <a href="/help?id=pr_slideshows">Slideshow Mode</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2.5 Blox.com Presentation Menus</h3>
<p>The main menus at the top of the presentation window - File, Edit, Slide, Insert, Tools, Help - contain more than 35 essential commands for creating a presentation. Get acquainted with these menus and have fun exploring some of the less obvious presentation features. For more info see the <a href="/help?id=pr_menuref">Blox.com presentation Menu reference</a>.</p>

<h3>2.2.6 The Format Bar</h3>
