I created this on 8/15/2001.
I think this was the first web developer toolbar ever.
To install it, right click on the inf and select install.
It will insert context menus into IE5 to allow you to view the 
DOM source instead of the view source and execute scripts on the page.
It was modeled after Microsoft's XML Validate IE5 add-on. (see XML\Validate XML)
