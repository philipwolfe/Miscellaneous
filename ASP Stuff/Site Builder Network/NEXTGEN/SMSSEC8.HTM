<a name="8"></a><h2>Section 8: Introduction</h2>
<P>The remainder of this guide takes you through a series of common user scenarios so that you can experience the capabilities of Systems Management Server 2.0 (Beta 2). Beginning with installing the product, this section will step you through the user interface, configuration, and client discovery. It also covers the various management functions such as software distribution, inventory, metering, and remote diagnostics.
<P>Some of the scenarios require a client computer, preferably one running Windows NT&#174; Workstation version 4.0. All scenarios require at least a server.
<P>


<a name="8.1"></a><H2>8.1 Installing Systems Management Server
</H2>
<P>This section walks you through the process of installing Systems Management Server 2.0 (Beta 2), and helps you become familiar with the user interface.
<P>The <a href="http://merchantgateway.cobweb.com/omega/order_entry_7.asp" target="_top">Systems Management Server 2.0 (Beta 2) CD-ROM</a> <IMG SRC="../../../sitebuilder/graphics/leave-ms.gif" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="11" BORDER="0" ALT="Non-MS link"> contains everything you need to install and run the product. Systems Management Server 2.0 has a version of SQL Server on the CD-ROM that can be automatically installed with Systems Management Server. This version of SQL Server is specific to Beta 2.
<P>Before you start the install you will need to:
<OL>

<LI>   Make sure your environment matches that described in <a href="smssec8.htm#appendix">Appendix C</a>.
<LI>   Prepare the following information:

</OL>
<UL>


<LI> <b>Name and password for your Systems Management Server Service account</b>--Systems Management Server Setup can create this account and password for you during the setup process (Systems Management Server uses SMSService as a default account name). If you prefer, you can create a service account by clicking Start, Programs, Administrative Tools, User Manager for Domains;  and then specify that name during setup. You can specify a local domain account by typing only the account name when prompted. You specify a trusted domain account by typing the domain and account name separated by a backslash. A trusted domain must be trusted by all domains within the site.
<LI> <b>Three-character Systems Management Server site code</b>--Systems Management Server uses a three-character site code to identify each site in your Systems Management Server system. Each site code needs to be unique. Systems Management Server will not prevent you from reusing a site code, but you cannot build a site hierarchy that includes two sites with identical codes.
<LI> <b>Systems Management Server site name</b>--The site name is the friendly name used to label each site. You can use up to 50 characters, including spaces; however, you may not use the following characters: <b>{ } &lt; &gt; " /</b>.
<LI> <b>Site domain</b>--The site domain is the name of the existing Windows NT domain that contains the site server.

</UL>
<H3>Installing a Systems Management Server Primary Site
</H3>
<P>Systems Management Server Setup can be accomplished through one of two different setup scenarios: Express or Custom. The type of setup scenario your server will use is dependent on whether or not you have SQL Server 6.5, Service Pack 3 or later installed on your computer before you begin Systems Management Server Setup. This test drive takes you through the Express setup option.
<P>Make sure the computer you are installing as a Systems Management Server site server matches the configuration in Appendix C, including running Windows NT version 4.0, Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01. The Systems Management Server CD-ROM contains Windows NT 4 Service Pack 3 and Internet Explorer 4.01, if you do not already have them (accessible from the install splash screen). Please install these first before continuing with the installation process.
<P>Log on to the server with an account that has administrator privileges. In other words, use an account that is a member of the Administrators group. This computer can be set up as a Primary Domain Controller, a Backup Domain Controller, or a stand-alone server. However, if you are using a member server, make sure that you log on to the proper domain.
<P>Insert the Systems Management Server CD-ROM into the server's CD-ROM drive. Setup should start automatically. The following screen appears, allowing you to set up Internet Explorer and Windows NT 4 Service Pack 3, or move on to Systems Management Server:
<P><img src="smsfig01.gif" WIDTH="484" HEIGHT="376" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 1.  Systems Management Server 2.0 Beta 2 setup</b>
<P>Click Set up SMS 2.0.
<P>When the Welcome screen appears, click Next.
<P><IMG SRC="smsfig02.gif" WIDTH="444" HEIGHT="357" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 2.  Welcome screen</b>


<P>Setup examines your computer to determine the current system configuration and informs you of any current Systems Management Server installations on the computer. When the System Configuration screen appears, click Next.
<P>When the Setup Options screen appears, select Install an SMS Primary Site, and then click Next.
<P>The Licensing window appears. After reading the license and accepting its terms, Click I agree that: in the licensing dialog box, and then click Continue.
<P>The Installation Options screen appears.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig03.gif" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="397" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 3.  Installation options</b>


<P>Click Express Setup (this is <i>not</i> the default selection), and then click Next. Fill in the boxes in the Product Registration window, and then click Next. You must enter some text (alphanumeric) for the Product ID. For Beta 2 there may not be a sticker with an associated CD-ROM key on the compact disk jewel case; use any numbers.
<P>When the SMS Site Information screen appears, enter the unique three-digit site code and the site name as discussed earlier (the site domain should be left unchanged). Click Next.
<P>The SMS Service Account Information screen appears next.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig04.gif" WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="314" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 4.  Systems Management Server Account Information screen</b>


<P>Either keep the default, or enter your Service Account name in the first box of this screen. Press your Tab key and enter your password. Press Tab again, re-enter your password, and then click Next.
<P>At the SMS Primary Site Client Load screen, enter the number of client computers that will be managed from this Systems Management Server primary site, and then click Next. This information will be used to size the SQL Server database that is being created automatically.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig05.gif" WIDTH="386" HEIGHT="310 BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 5.  SQL Server Administrator Account Screen</b>


<P>When the SQL Administrator Account screen appears, enter a password for your SA account if you want to assign a different one from your SMS Service account and then click Next.
<P>The Concurrent SMS Administrator Consoles screen now appears. Enter the number of Systems Management Server Administrator consoles you expect to have at your site (usually one) and then click Next.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig06.gif" WIDTH="443" HEIGHT="357" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 6.  Completing the Setup Wizard</b>


<P>Finally, the Completing the Systems Management Server Setup Wizard appears. Review the choices you made throughout Setup. If you would like to make changes, click Back until you reach the screen that has the information you would like to change. Then, make the change and click Next until you come back to this screen.
<P>When you are satisfied with your responses, click Finish. Systems Management Server will now be installed on your computer.
<P>Your next steps are to configure your site and your hierarchy. Before doing that however, briefly familiarize yourself with the user interface.
<P>
<H3>The Systems Management Server Administrator Console
</H3>
<P>The Systems Management Server Administrator console tree is an ordered hierarchical listing of related items and functionality. Each top-level node in the administrator display (directly beneath the Site Database node) represents a different Systems Management Server administrative function. Objects are grouped in a logical manner.
<P>You begin to use the Systems Management Server Administrator by navigating the Systems Management Server Administrator console tree. You navigate by moving from item to item, expanding and collapsing branches as needed to expose the items whose functional scope meets your administrative objectives. The following table describes the top-level nodes in the Systems Management Server Administrator console tree.

</TABLE>
<P>When using the Systems Management Server Administrator, you follow this general usage pattern:
<UL>


<LI> Determine the task you wish to perform.
<LI> Find the console tree item that deals with the task. (Use the online Help to assist you in identifying common Systems Management Server management tasks.)
<LI> Expand the Systems Management Server Administrator console tree to expose additional child items until you find the item you need to use.
<LI> Alter the item configuration by changing its properties.

</UL>Some management tasks with broad functional scope, such as site configuration, require viewing and setting several different items in the Systems Management Server Administrator console tree.
<P><b>The Action Menu</b>
<P>Depending on the currently selected Systems Management Server Administrator console tree item, the Action menu displays choices appropriate to that item. These menu items can be accessed by selecting the item and clicking on Action, or by right-clicking on the item. The following screen shot shows an Action menu for a site system.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig07.gif" WIDTH="452" HEIGHT="341" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 7.  The Action menu</b>


<P><b>Properties Dialog Boxes</b>
<P>To change the configuration of an item, you change that item's properties. If an item is configurable, you may display its Properties dialog box in any of the following ways:
<UL>


<LI> Click the Properties icon in the Systems Management Server toolbar.
<LI> Choose Properties from the Action menu.
<LI> Choose Properties from the right-click Pop-Up menu.
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig08.gif" WIDTH="342" HEIGHT="397" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 8.  Properties pop-up menu</b>



<P>Filling in the data fields of the dialog box changes the properties of the selected item.
<P>
<H3>Obtaining Help
</H3>
<P>Systems Management Server 2.0 has an extensive, task-based HTML Help system that provides the following:
<UL>


<LI> An online version of the <i>Getting Started</i> book.
<LI> Information on how to use the Systems Management Server console tree to manage your Systems Management Server system.
<LI> Information on how each component of Systems Management Server works.
<LI> Details about the elements in each dialog box.
<LI> Links to Systems Management Server-related Internet Web sites.
<LI> Context-sensitive help for any item in the Systems Management Server Administrator console tree.

</UL>Context-sensitive help can be accessed at any time by selecting F1.
<P>Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the different action and property options available for the different tasks in the administrator console. Once you are complete, you can tune the product for use and investigate the extensive management information available.
<P>


<a name="8.2"></a><H2>8.2 Managing the Manager
</H2>
<P>A key requirement from systems administrators has been to provide them with the tools to develop exactly the systems management support they need. To address this issue with Systems Management Server 2,0, we have added extensive configuration information. The default is always sensible, but for the more sophisticated administrator, the ability to fine-tune every component of the system is critical. In this section we will look at the configurable nature of the system, concentrating on Site Settings and Site Status.
<P>
<H3>Site Settings
</H3>
<P>When examining these facilities, in most cases we will keep the default settings. However, in some later exercises we will return to this area of the administrator console to change some defaults.
<P>To get to site settings select:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;site name&gt;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Settings
<P>The following section describes Systems Management Server 2.0 single-site configuration settings. Please follow each one on your system.
<P>Start by expanding the Site Settings option in the left window, and you will see the following options listed below it:
<UL>


<LI> Site Systems
<LI> Discovery Methods
<LI> Client Installation Methods
<LI> Client Agents
<LI> Addresses
<LI> Senders
<LI> Connection Accounts
<LI> Status Filter Rules
<LI> Status Summarizer
<LI> Component Configuration
<LI> Database Maintenance

</UL>For each entry you will be able to see a series of configuration categories. For each category you will be able to change the properties of the existing instance of that category or create a new instance of that category.
<P><b>Site Systems</b>
<P>This node allows the creation and configuration of site systems.
<b> </b>A site system is a server, share, or NetWare volume that provides Systems Management Server functionality to the site. Under this node, you can indicate which functions are going to be done by which site systems, therefore allowing the flexibly to distribute the management overhead through a computing environment. For instance, one computer could handle the SQL Server processing, another could drive the software metering facilities, and a third could handle the sender functions. This node also allows analysis of an existing site system, for instance by running a network trace to understand how this system is related to another system in the site. In a test environment it makes the most sense to keep the defaults and leave all the functions on the default site system.
<P>This is also one of the locations from which you can launch the Network Trace feature. This is launched by selecting a particular site system and opening the Action menu. Network Trace is discussed in detail <a href="smssec8.htm#networkdisc">below</a>.
<P><b>Discovery Methods</b>
<P>This node allows the administrator to define how Systems Management Server discovers resources such as users and machines. For instance, resources could be discovered by user log-ons, or by listening for network activity.
<P>There are six categories available to modify. We will talk more about resource discovery in <a href="smssec8.htm#8.3">section 8.3 below</a>.
<P><b>Client Installation Methods</b>
<P>Once Systems Management Server has discovered a resource, it needs to install the client to drive management operations. This node provides you with the ability to configure this to happen in one of many different ways. This is discussed in detail in <a href="smssec8.htm#8.3">section 8.3 below</a>.

<P><B>Client Agents</b>
<P>Once the agent is installed, there are many operations that it can perform. Not all clients must perform the same operations--an administrator may want to provide software distribution but not remote diagnostics, for instance. The configuration settings for these options are available under this node. We will discuss these settings as we discuss the operations in <a href="smssec8.htm#8.4">sections 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7 below</a>.

<P><B>Addresses</b>
<P>Addresses can be configured through this node. They are used to enable sites to communicate via senders. We will keep the defaults in this case, as we are not investigating inter-site communication in these exercises.

<P><B>Senders</b>
<P>This node provides access to sender creation and configuration. Senders are mechanisms for communicating between sites. In this case we are going to keep the standard sender. In a WAN environment you may want to add RAS or Courier Senders, and modify the working of the standard LAN and WAN senders.

<P><B>Connection Accounts</b>
<P>Server and client accounts used by Systems Management Server can be created and modified through this node.

<P><B>Status Filter Rules</b>
<P>This node provides access to configuration information about the way that status messages are to be filtered and forwarded to other sites in the hierarchy. Status is discussed in more detail later in this section.
<P><b>Status Summarizer</b>
<P>This node provides access to configuration information about the way that status information is to be summarized and stored. Status is discussed in more detail later in this section.

<P><B>Component Configuration</b>
<P>Some operations, such as metering and software distribution, have component-level configuration settings in addition to client configurations. The component level configurations are set at this node and are discussed when we investigate those functions in <a href="smssec8.htm#8.4">sections 8.4 and 8.6 below</a>.

<P><B>Database Maintenance</b>
<P>Systems Management Server 2.0 greatly extends the database configuration available so that operations need not be performed directly on SQL Server Enterprise Manager. This execution is defined at this node.
<P>Spend some time examining each of these options.
<P>Because Systems Management Server is hosted inside the Microsoft Management Console it is possible to assign certain of these tasks to certain administrators. For instance, if you wanted an administrator to be tasked with managing Systems Management Server itself (rather than using it for distribution, inventory or diagnostics) you can do the following:
<OL>

<LI>In the Scope window expand Site Hierarchy, the local site, and Site Settings.
<LI>Right-click the Action menu and click New Window from Here.

</OL>A new console has been created that is specifically targeted at an administrator whose only role is to manage Systems Management Server.
<P>Once you have spent some time investigating the flexibility provided through site settings, move on to site status.
<P>
<H3>Site Status
</H3>
<P>To view site status information, select:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;System Status
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Status
<P>Start by selecting your server from the list in the left window (there is probably only one). You will be offered the option of status messages on components or site systems. Investigate both, the output will appear in the right window.
<P>For each of the many Systems Management Server components running on that server, you can see the status of that component, the events that are happening and have happened on your system, and whether they are warnings or errors. This information is invaluable for a systems administrator to understand the status of operations.
<P>Information is provided for the site and for each component. This allows you to see problems not only at the main server, but also at the distribution points as software is distributed, and at the clients as software is installed or other operations are performed. In this way you can follow a process through and be sure that it completes successfully.
<P>Status information can also be filtered and forwarded to other servers in the hierarchy, allowing a summation of the state of the system to be created.
<P>Experiment with the options that are available through the Action menu (by right-clicking the selected server). In particular, click Task and then Network Trace.
<P>
<a name="networkdisc"></a><H3>Network Discovery and Network Trace
</H3>
<P>You can either access Network Trace as described immediately above, via site status. Or you can select it from:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Systems
<P>Select the site system in the right window and launch the Action menu.
<P>By default, this option only discovers information collected through server discovery, so the display may be quite basic. To make it more sophisticated, let's go ahead and configure network discovery, which feeds network trace.
<P>To get to Network Discovery, select:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovery Methods
<P>In the Results window, click Network Discovery, and then the Action menu. Click Properties. The Network Discovery Properties dialog box displays General settings for network discovery. Notice that by default, network discovery is enabled, and it is configured to discover topology, clients and client operating systems. However, network discovery will not run until we tell it to do so.
<P>Before we trigger network discovery, investigate the following options:
<P><b>Click the Subnets tab</b> - Notice that by default, network discovery is configured to discover resources on the local subnet. It will also add discover resources on any subnet that a site system is on. You can also specify additional subnets.
<P><b>Click the Domains tab</b> - The dialog box displays domain settings for network discovery. Notice that by default, network discovery is configured to discover resources in the local domain of the site server. You can add new domains.
<P><b>Click the SNMP tab</b> - The dialog box displays SNMP settings for network discovery. Notice that by default, network discovery is configured to discover resources within one hop if using SNMP in the public community. You can increase the hop count or add new community names.
<P><b>Click the SNMP Devices tab</b> - Notice that by default, network discovery is not configured to discover any devices other than routers or DHCP servers.
<P><b>Click the DHCP tab</b> - The dialog box displays DHCP settings for network discovery. Notice that by default, network discovery is not configured to discover resources by querying a DHCP server. If you have a DHCP Server and want to use it to provide IP Addresses for discovery, click the New Item button and type in the name or IP Address of your DHCP Server. This is recommended.
<P><b>Click the Schedule tab</b> - The dialog box displays schedule settings for network discovery. Notice that by default, network discovery is not configured to start. A schedule <i>must</i> be configured for network discovery to complete:
<OL>

<LI>   Click the New Item button. The Schedule dialog box appears.
<LI>   Under Time, verify the current date is configured and then set the time to five minutes past the current time.
<LI>   Under Recurrence pattern, set the recurring interval to one day.
<LI>   Click OK. The dialog box displays schedule settings for network discovery. Notice network discovery is scheduled to start in a few minutes.
<LI>   Click OK.

</OL>We will need to wait a few minutes before returning to the Network Trace display. Discovery is designed to be nonintrusive, so it does take some time to complete.
<P>Check back on Network Trace later and you should see a more sophisticated display that includes a trace of your Systems Management Server site and information on the roles of the various site servers (there may only be one in your configuration). The more complicated your environment, the more sophisticated this display will be.
<P>When you check back, investigate the buttons at the top of the display. The three on the right allow you to ping devices, and to poll for the correct functioning of components.

<a name="8.3"></a><H2>8.3 Discovering and Managing Resources
</H2>
<P>To manage clients using Systems Management Server requires agent components running on client systems. Version 2.0 has been designed to provide the flexibility to very specifically decide which management facilities should run on each system (you can just do software distribution without doing inventory or metering, for instance).
<P>To get the specific components installed requires:
<UL>


<LI> Finding the systems
<LI> Installing the agent on the system
<LI> Enabling components of the agent

</UL>In this section we will discuss the first two parts of this process, discovery and installation. The next sections will explain how to enable the agent and perform management tasks.
<P>Systems Management Server 2.0 is not limited to discovering only personal computers. Many new discovery mechanisms are available to allow you to discover a wide range of different types of <i>resources</i>.
<P>
<H3>Configuring Resource Discovery
</H3>
<P>In Systems Management Server 2.0, resources include the hardware, Windows NT user groups, and Windows NT user accounts that you can manage with Systems Management Server. Hardware resources include personal computers, servers, and network devices such as routers. Resources are discovered on your network according to their types--different discovery methods are provided for the different resource types.
<P>Systems Management Server discovers all the resources throughout your network; it is not restricted to the site boundaries that you define. The location of each resource is then compared to the site boundaries you have set and the resource is assigned to the appropriate site or sites.
<P>Discovery mechanisms for Systems Management Server 2.0 (Beta 2) include:
<UL>


<LI> Network Discovery
<LI> Windows Networking User Group Discovery
<LI> Windows Networking User Account Discovery
<LI> Windows Networking Logon Discovery
<LI> Netware NDS Logon Discovery
<LI> Netware Bindery Server Logon Discovery
<LI> Heartbeat Discovery

</UL>Other discovery mechanisms, such as using Active Directory for discovery, will be added in the future.
<P>Resource discovery methods are enabled, disabled, and configured under Discovery Methods in the Systems Management Server console tree.
<P>To navigate to this node:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovery Methods
<P>We are going to use the Windows Networking Logon discovery mechanism in this exercise.
<P>First, before we configure it on the administrator console, let's make sure that we have a client machine to be discovered. Make sure that the client machine you want to manage for the rest of these exercises is correctly configured to allow discovery. (In these exercises we are assuming that the client is a Windows NT Workstation, but it could also be running Windows&reg; 95, Windows 98 or Windows for Workstations.)
<P>Create a user account to be used from the client machine, or verify that there is a user account for this domain already available. This needs to be done first so that the administrator console changes we make are applied to all accounts.
<P><b>To Create a User Account</b>
<P>Start User Manager for Domains and create a user account with the following parameters.

<H3>Installing the Agent on the Client
</H3>
<P>To navigate to this functionality:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Client Installation Methods
<P>Systems Management Server client software can be installed by any of the following installation methods:
<P><b>Windows networking logon client installation - </b>When a computer within the site boundaries logs on to the Windows-based network, Systems Management Server installs the client software on that computer.
<P><b>Windows NT remote client installation - </b>Systems Management Server client software is automatically installed on Windows NT-based computers within the site boundaries. The Windows NT-based computers need to be turned on and connected to the network. It is not necessary for anyone to be logged on to these computers.
<P><b>Manual Windows networking network connection client installation - </b>The user must explicitly connect to a file on a Windows NT logon point to install the Systems Management Server client software. This method provides for those cases where no logon script is used.
<P><b>NetWare Bindery server logon client installation - </b>When a computer logs on to a NetWare bindery server, Systems Management Server installs the client software on that computer.
<P><b>NetWare NDS logon client installation - </b>When a computer within the site boundaries logs on to the NetWare NDS context, Systems Management Server installs the client software on that computer.
<P><b>Manual NetWare NDS network connection client installation - </b>The user must explicitly connect to a file on a NetWare NDS logon point to install Systems Management Server client software.
<P><b>Manual NetWare Bindery connection client installation - </b>The user must explicitly connect to a file on a NetWare Bindery logon server to install Systems Management Server client software.
<P>You can use more than one installation method.
<P>We are using the Windows networking logon client installation mechanism in this exercise. Because we have already defined the logon script in the discovery process, there is nothing further for us to do. Other client setup methods require further configuration at this level.
<P>In the following procedure, we will verify that the account that was created earlier is ready to be used:
<OL>

<LI>   Start User Manager for Domains, and then click the account you created.
<LI>   On the User<b> </b>menu, click Properties.
<LI>   The User Properties<b> </b>dialog box appears. Click Profile. The User Environment Profile dialog box appears. Notice that <i>smsls</i><b> </b>has been added as the Logon Script Name.
<LI>   Exit User Manager for Domains.

</OL>
<H3>Adding the Client Computer to the Site
</H3>
<P>In this exercise, we will add your client computer to your Systems Management Server site:
<OL>

<LI>   Restart your client computer. Log onto your computer as the new account you created.
<LI>   A command prompt appears briefly as the Systems Management Server client software discovery and installation begins. This process is completed in stages, and even though the window is removed, the discovery and installation processes still execute for a few moments.
<LI>   Log on to your computer as the new account you created.

</OL>In the following procedure, we will view the properties of the newly added Systems Management Server client.

Notice under Discovery data, all the discovered properties of the client are displayed. We will look in more detail at the full extent of the collected inventory information in a later exercise.
<LI>   Click Close.

</OL>While examining collections it is also worth looking at the results of other discovery processes. For instance, investigate the resource information that is available under the following collections:
<UL>


<LI> All Users
<LI> All User Groups

</UL>In the next exercises we will use this agent to drive management operations.
<P>


<a name="8.4"></a><H2>8.4 Distributing and Installing Software
</H2>
<P>One of the key features of Systems Management Server is to distribute and install software. Systems Management Server has the flexibility to distribute a software package to a collection that can contain machines, users, and user groups. A collection can contain a subset of one of these resources based on inventory information collected (for instance, all machines that have more that 16 MB of RAM).
<P>There are a number of components to distributing software:
<UL>


<LI> Creating a Collection (with or without a query)
<LI> Configuring Software Distribution
<LI> Advertising a Program
<LI> Creating a Package
<LI> Creating a Program
<LI> Creating an Advertisement
<LI> Installing the Software on the Client Machine

</UL>Systems Management Server comes with a software distribution wizard that easily steps you through these operations.
<P>In this exercise we are going to outline the procedure for rolling out Service Pack 3 of Windows NT 4.0 to a Windows NT Workstation that is running Windows NT 4.0 and is in our local subnet. Therefore, the ideal client to have is a Windows NT Workstation. However, if you have a Windows 95-based client you may be able to make substitutions as you move through the exercise.
<P>
<H3>Creating a Collection (via a Query)
</H3>
<P>In this exercise, we will create a collection that will be used as the target to advertise a software program. This collection will be dynamically created as a result of a query that checks to see which machines are currently running Windows NT 4.0 and are in the local subnetwork.
<P>Navigate to the Queries node:

<H3>Installing the Software on the Client Machine
</H3>
<P>In this exercise, we will install the software distribution components on the client computer.
<P>One of the key features that Systems Management Server 2.0 offers is the ability to work in elevated privilege. A user without administrative privileges on their workstation would not be able to install Service Pack 3, but that should not stop a successful deployment from happening. So, first we are going to try and run the program directly as a user, and then we are going to distribute it to the user through Systems Management Server. <i>The first will fail; the second will succeed.</i>
<P><b>Run the Program Directly</b>
<OL>

<LI>On the server, share out the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 from the CD-ROM so that the client can access this share.
<LI>Log on to the Windows NT Workstation as the user we created earlier.
<LI>Connect to the server's NT4SP3 share.
<LI>Run update.exe /u (this is exactly the command that Systems Management Server runs).
<LI>A Service Pack setup error occurs indicating we don't have permissions to update the system.
<LI>Disconnect from the NT4SP3 share.

</OL>So we cannot run it directly. However, when Systems Management Server encounters this problem it automatically switches over to running at an elevated privilege level.

<P><b>Running the Program from Systems Management Server</b>

<H3>Year 2000 Compliance Checking
</H3>
<P>Beta 2 has added tools to check for Year 2000 compliance, based on the software inventory information. These tools will be improved before the product is released.
<P>Perform the following steps to investigate this functionality:
<P>Firstly, navigate to the Year 2000 database:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Y2K Database
<P>Here you will find a list of compliance levels for Microsoft products. This list is current as of Beta 2. You can update this list, add compliance information from other vendors, or add compliance checking for European compliance by doing the following:
<ol>
<li>Select the Y2K Database node, then on the Action menu click Import. This gives you a dialog box where you can specify a new database to load. The database format expected is tab-delimited. The Microsoft Year 2000 site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/y2k/" target="_top">http://www.microsoft.com/y2k/</a> provides the most up-to-date version of this file for Microsoft applications.
<li>Once you have a database that contains compliance details (the database shipping with Beta 2 will work fine for this operation) you can go ahead and find out if you have Year 2000 compliance issues in your network. Systems Management Server is going to do a comparison of this compliance data with information obtained from the software inventory scan.
<li>Navigate to the query node:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Queries
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y2K Non Compliant Software on Systems by Version
<li>Run the query by selecting the Action menu and clicking Run Query. The query will run and in the Results window you will see a list of applications which have compliance problems. This format will be modified before the product is released, specifically the value <i>2</i> maps to <i>compliant with issues</i> and the value <i>3</i> maps to <i>not compliant.</i>

<a name="8.6"></a><H2>8.6 Software Metering
</H2>
<P>Software metering is a new feature in Systems Management Server 2.0. It gives administrators the ability to monitor and prevent application use dependent on their criteria, or to track application use for charge-back purposes.
<P>
<H3>Configuring Software Metering
</H3>
<P>In this exercise, we will configure the software metering component for Systems Management Server 2.0. The first thing we need to do is define which of our servers is going to be the software metering server:
<P>Navigate to the site server:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Systems
<OL>

<LI>In the Results window, select your site server, and then on the Action menu click Properties.
<LI>Click the Software Metering tab.
<LI>Click Use Site System as a Software Metering Server.
<LI>In the Database Location box, type a path for the local software metering data cache (the default is fine), and then click OK.

</OL>We will need to wait for up to 30 minutes before this takes effect. While waiting we can modify the software metering configuration for the site:
<P>Navigate to the component configuration:
<P>Systems Management Server
<br>&nbsp;Site Database (&lt;name&gt;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Hierarchy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Component Configuration

<LI>Click OK.
<LI>The Defining Metered Software window displays Notepad as a licensed program.
<LI>Under Licensed software, click Notepad, and then click Properties. The Properties dialog box displays Identification properties for Notepad.
<LI>Click the License Balancing tab. The Properties dialog box displays License Balancing properties for Notepad.
<LI>Click to cancel "Do not enforce the license limits for this product" until a trend has been calculated, and then click OK. The Defining Licensed Software window displays Notepad as a licensed program.
<LI>On the Summary menu, click Software Metering Summary.
<LI>Click the Licensed tab. Notepad.exe appears with a total of one license available at the site with none available at the software metering server. Leave this window open.

</OL>By default, licenses added at a site are not balanced to a server for seven days to allow monitoring of applications to do trend analysis. At the end of this trend analysis period, licenses are balanced to the software metering servers that need them. However, we disabled the trend analysis for Notepad by canceling "Do not enforce the license limits for this product until a trend has been calculated." With this canceled the server will do license balancing but only after a request has been made for a license. So, to force this balancing, we need to run Notepad on the client and receive a denial.
<OL>

<LI>At the client, start Notepad. A software-metering message appears indicating no licenses are available.
<LI>Click No Callback.

</OL>Now that a denial has occurred, license balancing can take place. However, it is on a 15-minute schedule, so wait 15 minutes before continuing.
<P>Now that everything is finally ready, let's have a look at how metering is able to control application use on the client computer:
<OL>

<LI>Shut down, and then restart the <i>client computer</i> (this may not be a necessary step). Log on as the domain user.
<LI>Start Notepad.exe. The Notepad window appears.

</OL>In the <i>administrator user interface</i>:
<OL>

<LI>Click Refresh Now in the Licensed Software window.
<LI>Notepad appears with a total of one license available and it is in use.
<LI>Start a second copy of notepad. The license is refused and a callback is offered.
<LI>Try copying notepad.exe to another name and running it. The license is still refused as it is checking the header information.

</OL>

<P>Software metering also has the ability to control software use based on time of day. For instance, a corporation may want to disable the playing of games during business hours. Experiment with this facility in metering by double-clicking a licensed application (such as Notepad) under the Defining Metered Software window, and then selecting the Permissions tab. Also observe the other configuration options available under Permissions, Alerts, and Rules.

<P><IMG SRC="smsfig11.gif" WIDTH="479" HEIGHT="354" BORDER="0" ALT="*">
<P><b>Figure 11.  Permissions for software use are set through software metering</b>


<P>Charge-back is another powerful feature of software metering. Not only is this tool able to monitor application use, it also monitors the length of time applications are used for. This data is then available for an IS department to use to charge other departments for use of developed or deployed applications, or use of services such as the Internet. Experiment with this facility by examining the Duration column in the Software Metering Summary window.
<P>Investigate the graphing and reporting wizards that are new features in Beta 2.

<a name="8.7"></a><H2>8.7 Remote Diagnostics
</H2>
<P>The remote diagnostics tools in Systems Management Server 2.0 are faster and more robust that in previous versions. Their configuration is also more granular, especially from a security context. Also, in Beta 2 a new server health monitoring feature has been added, called HealthMon.
<P>HealthMon is at preview quality in Beta 2, and should not be used in production environments.
<P>The following exercises will examine HealthMon and remote control.
<P>
<H3>HealthMon
</H3>
<P>HealthMon is intended to be an example of the power of the WBEM infrastructure underlying Systems Management Server 2.0.

<P>*Please note the following additional client restrictions that are specific to Beta 2:
<OL>

<LI>Novell NDS support is only available for Windows 95 and Windows 98 clients, not Windows NT Workstation.
<LI>Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 support is available for Beta 2, but may not be at the same quality level as the other client operating systems supported.
<LI>Windows NT 5 builds have been tested as a both a server and a client platform but should not be assumed to work fully. Windows NT 4 Service Pack 3 is the recommended server environment and other clients are assumed to work more reliably.
<LI>Software metering is not available for either Netware clients or 16-bit Windows clients.
<LI>Beta 2 supports neither Windows Terminal Server clients, nor Windows CE clients.

</OL>
