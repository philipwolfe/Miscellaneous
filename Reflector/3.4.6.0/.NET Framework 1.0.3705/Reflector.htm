<h1>.NET Reflector Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>
The following FAQ answers some of the most common questions about .NET Reflector.
</p>

<b>How to load a type from command line?</b>
<p>
You can use the '/member' switch which takes a full XML doc member key to identify a type, method, field. For example: 'Reflector.exe /member:T:System.Object'.
</p>


<b>Where is the 'References' item gone?</b>
<p>
There is a 'Dependencies' item for each Module instead of one for the entire Assembly.
The item also shows Navitve Win32 modules used by DllImport. 
Furthermore you can get a list of all the referenced members for any referenced 
assembly (right-click and call "Assembly Member Dependencies" or Ctrl-R).
</p>

<b>How to select from a search tool and copy to clipboard?</b>
<p>
This is supported in recent versions. All search windows all you multi-select members and copy their names to the clipboard (Ctrl-C).
</p>

<b>What is new to Call Tree?</b>
<p>
The call tree tool shows you a tree of methods that could possibly be called by the selected method.
In newer versions of Reflector it also expands derived sub types so you can drill into interfaces
and abstract members by looking at their implementation.
</p>

<b>How can I organize the main view by Namespace?</b>
<p>
Reflector supports a namespace-centric mode. 
Here is the trick: Open the view menu, click the customize item and enable the "Flatten Namespaces" checkbox.
</p>

<b>Does Reflector support XML Documentation viewing?</b>
<p>
Reflector includes an XML documentation viewer.
Select a type, constructor, method, property, field or event and hit the F1 key.
The program will either find the documentation file automatically or it will ask for it.
For .NET Framework APIs you can also use the MSDN Help lookup from the Tools menu.
</p>

<b>How can I figure out the action for a selected item?</b>
<p>
Reflector supports context menus (which can be opened by right-clicking on a node in the browser window).
This is often the quickest way to find out what you can do with that item.
</p>

<b>Why does Reflector hold my file locked after "Close"?</b>
<p>
This is a problem with the CLR, not with Reflector. 
Right now, the CLR does not support an easy way to unload assemblies from memory. 
Even after running 'File\Close' the CLR still keeps the file in memory. 
The only way to release the lock is to restart reflector.
</p>

<b>What is the difference between 'File\Open' and 'File\Open Name'?</b>
<p>
The "File\Open Name" menu allows you to open files that are already loaded into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). 
However, when using this option you will find it harder to access the XML documentation that is often stored in the same directory as the original EXE/DLL. 
To avoid this load the EXE/DLL from its original location.</p>

<b>How do Bookmarks work?</b>
<p>
The Bookmarks tool only works for types, constructors, methods, fields, properties and events at the moment.
You can add a selected node to the bookmarks list using the INS key and remove it by pressing DEL.
</p>

<b>How do I search for a particular type?</b>
<p>
Type Search (F3) shows you all the types available in the loaded assemblies
(taking your visibilities settings into consideration).
The tool works like a dictionary index and typing syllables
in the header boxes is filtering the lower part. 
Put quotes arround a word to only show those members which match the entire word. 
The search stops after 1000 elements.
You should already have an idea what you are looking for at that point - use filtering to get more.
The progess bar at the bottom shows the percentage of the loaded assemblies that is already processed.
</p>

<b>How do I use the Member Search to find a particular member?</b>
<p>
Member Search (F4) works the same way as Type Search works. It is a bit slower and shows all members as well (types, constructors, methods, fields, properties, events).
</p>

<b>What is Member References Search and why is it so slow?</b>
<p>
The Member references (Shift-F4) tool searches through all of the IL code to find all the members that refer to the 
node that was selected. The Member References Search tool is very slow at the moment so it can take 
some time until the search finishes. The search scope is limited for private and internal members.
The search can also be made quicker by using the filter and unloading large assemblies which you do not want to search.
</p>

<b>What is Type Reference Search?</b>
<p>
The Type References Search shows all the members that refer to the selected type in their Meta Data. 
The IL code is not searched. This will speed up the search, but may not give you all the results 
you are looking for.
</p>

<b>How do I find out what the various IL op-codes do?</b>
<p>
Move your mouse cursor over the op-code in the Disassembler view and wait for the Tooltip.
</p>

<b>How can I view language-specific definitions?</b>
<p>
Reflector supports an outline view which shows the full definition of a selected assembly, module, namespace or type in your language of choice. 
It might take a little while to compile this information for assemblies and modules.
The Outline view supports printing (right-click to access Print in the context menu).
</p>

<b>Can I get Tooltips based off of the XML documentation?</b>
<p>
This feature is not supported in Reflector currently, but might be in upcoming versions.
